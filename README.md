## Description 🧐
Using Feathers.js I built a MVP version of a live chat application. This will eventually be integrated into a user bodyweight gym profile page. This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.
## Motivation 🚀
I wanted to learn Feathers.js and also build out a members only chat application.
